- finish up index.js "main" file
- pupeteer is huge (+300MB), gosh

# Ongoing considerations

# possible libs to consider or look into for inspiration

- clui — draws command-line tables, gauges and spinners
- inquirer — creates interactive command-line user interface
- configstore — easily loads and saves config without you having to think about where and how.
